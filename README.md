# Advanced Fintech Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Advanced Financial Technology coursework, covering a mix of theoretical insight, coding, and smart contract implementation.

## Content

- `Q1.ipynb` – Exploratory data analysis and insights into global fintech trends using Python.
- `Q2.ipynb` – Python-based financial modeling and simulation for an experimental scenario.
- `Q3_front_end.html` – A simple interactive frontend for a blockchain-based smart contract puzzle (developed in Remix IDE).
- `Q3_updated.pdf` – Full write-up and smart contract explanation for the Q3 experiment platform, including design, code, and deployment steps.

## Notes

- Smart contract logic was developed and tested using Remix IDE.
- The frontend is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and simulates how a participant interacts with the contract.
- All work reflects personal effort, research, and implementation under the provided academic brief.

Thank you for reviewing the submission.
